## Motivation
The so called NBA draft might be one, if not the most crucial moment of the basketball world every year.
Players from all around the world come to the draft to try their luck to become a tiny (or sometimes huge) part of the best basketball league, the National Basketball Association in the United States of America.

The largest resource of the NBA has always been the North American colleges. Most of the all-time greatest players came and are still coming from universities within USA's boarders. However, the tendency has swifted during the last few years. Lots of promiseful and amazing players have arrived to the league from other continents, such as Europe or Asia, and participated quite successfully on the NBA draft.

It is a very-very exciting question for everyone around the league, or with some passion or love for the game of basketball, that actually who are going to be selected by which team during the current NBA Draft. It is not only an interesting question for the fans, but a serious and maybe life-changing decision for the NBA teams to select the most propriate young talent amongst the thousands or tens of thousands of basketball players. The NBA teams put an unimagineable amount of effort and time into analysis and research before the draft night, to explore every single possible candidate and discover all the details about their abilities and talent as a basketball player. For this process, they probably trust a lot on intuition, but (hopefully) they might trust a little bit on the statistics, because "numbers don't lie".

Since I consider myself to be one of those millions of people who feel the love for this game, and I have always been really interested in how the real pros who work for the league and the teams do their job when it comes to the draft, I decided to try my best on analyzing player statistics myself and make predictions on who might by good enough based on the numbers to be selected on the NBA draft (2 rounds, 30 players are selected per each round).

Currently, I am only working with college basketball statistical data, therefore it does not cover all the draft picks, since some of the selected players come from other countries and leagues. For instance, they might be players of a team which participates in EuroLeague, the most precisious European basketball tournament ever.

Although, in the future, it might be a better solution that brings more precise and accurate predictions to extend the sources and integrate statistics of players who are not playing for North American college basketball teams, but playing for some of the top European or Asian teams at a young age.

## Research questions
Based on the motivation, my aim is to predict whether a player will be selected on a draft or not. Is it possible to construct a model which beats the random model? If yes, then how accurate the model is? As a next step for the model, can it also predict certain picks or at least the round, where the given player would be most probably selected? Also, the same question rises here as well: how accurate the model is?

I am looking forward to find a satisfying answer for all the questions mentioned above.

## Data source
For this project I used three different data files that I found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021?resource=download).
Two of the files are in csv format containing college basketball player statistics from 2009 to 2022. The third one contains all drafted players per year between 2009 and 2021.
